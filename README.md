# Task List API

This project is a simple task list API using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The project has the following features:

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Edit tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks.
- Data persistence with MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

First, ensure that you have the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Download the latest version from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Check the latest npm version by running the command: `npm install npm@latest -g`.
- **MongoDB**: You need to have a MongoDB server running locally on the default port (27017) or set up a remote instance. Visit [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/) for installation instructions or cloud setup.
- **create-react-app**: This is only necessary if you're setting up a new React project. You can install it globally by running the command: `npm install -g create-react-app`.
